# IndexNow production draft: romansbuildingservices.com

Source baseline `81254f5473d56dcd0b4f73e06e928d251ccbe1a2`. Netlify signed deploy-succeeded event. Draft only; no public key/file, configuration, deployment or URL submission was performed. This document does not claim Wizard IndexNow is enabled.

## Concrete implementation

- `scripts/indexnow/core.mjs`: exact HTTPS canonical host, no ports/credentials/queries, fragment dedupe, recursive page sitemap selection, rendered text/metadata/link/JSON-LD fingerprints instead of sitemap timestamps. Live page200/self-canonical/HTML/noindex checks fail closed; an inaccessible page stops the job.
- `cli.mjs`: dry-run default; live mode requires actual public key and explicit enablement. Published `/.well-known/indexnow-release.json` must match the exact sourceSHA before and after collection, preventing queued/superseded events from mixing releases.
- `prepare-release.mjs` runs in normal prebuild, generating only host/sourceSHA metadata. No key is generated or written. `public/.well-known/indexnow-release.json` is ignored source output; `public/indexnow-key.txt` is absent until specifically approved.
- Approved observational baseline is separate from notifications. Initial missing state stops submission; `baseline` records current fingerprints without notifying. Later publication detects added/changed pages, probes removed pages and submits only404/410 removals; redirects/other statuses stay held for owner decisions. A one-URL test cannot include another URL/removal.
- Before each POST, persist its intent.200/202 receipts persist separately,202 flagged validation pending; fingerprints advance only after receipt. Any failed/ambiguous POST leaves durable pending intent and blocks further automatic sends until owner reconciliation. No automatic network retry.500URL batches; no exactly-once claim across storage failure/ambiguous upstream receipt.

## State and publishing trigger

Existing Netlify platform site-wide Blobs namespace `indexnow-production-state`, strong consistency, conditional ETag writes and a conditional per-host writer lock. Package @netlify/blobs10.7.13 is pinned. Platform runtime credentials are automatic; no new PAT/database/vendor. Storage/function use consumes existing site allowances and must be approved before activation; no plan upgrade is included. A crashed writer lock never expires automatically: owner reconciliation avoids overlapping writers after a timeout.

Trigger is dormant until source is published and explicit configuration is approved. No PR-preview/build-completion event can notify. Vercel workflow requires successful `Production` event with `production_environment:true` plus repository variable `INDEXNOW_ENABLED=true`. It waits60seconds and confirms the published SHA; GitHub concurrency coalesces queued events by rejecting stale markers. Provider emission of those exact event fields is not yet verified; the connector did not expose deployments for inspection. Do not loosen the guard or enable a different event without review. Manual workflow operations allow dry-run, approved baseline, and exactly one approved URL; ordinary automatic sends remain disabled until the variable is approved. GitHub token permissions are narrowed to contents/actions read; no external permission setting changes were made.

Romans instead uses platform-signed production deploy event, exact siteID/context/state/published timestamp/host/commit. Background config allows bounded collection time; source uses native Netlify signature protection. Wait60seconds before marker checks; conditional state writer lock prevents overlap. Runtime `INDEXNOW_ENABLED` defaults absent/disabled and `INDEXNOW_MODE` defaults dry-run. Worker catches errors to prevent platform background retries, preserving pending intent; crashed lock/pending record needs reconciliation.

## Exact approval sequence

1. Review this exact draft source/tests and production base. Reconcile existing key/plugin/automation metadata; reuse an existing legitimate integration if found.
2. If no key exists, separately approve one public host-verification key for `romansbuildingservices.com`. No Bing API credential. Add actual approved UTF-8 key-only file `public/indexnow-key.txt` (no placeholder) → `https://romansbuildingservices.com/indexnow-key.txt`; sender uses that exact root keyLocation. Set only the matching public-key runtime/repository field after explicit per-action approval, never a Bing credential.
3. Approve exact tested commit deployment plus generated release marker/keyfile; retain production rollback. Leave automatic submission disabled. Read-only GET must verify200/plain-text/key match and exact canonical candidate page.
4. Separately approve an observational baseline snapshot (no submissions). Vercel: manual `baseline` workflow dispatch at the exact published SHA, storing its artifact. Romans: an approved production publish with explicit baseline operation/enable flag stores the snapshot in the approved namespace; reset operation/disable after that event. No inferred acceptance/indexing of baseline pages.
5. Separately approve one URL `https://romansbuildingservices.com/` after checking canonical root spelling. Vercel manual `single-url` dispatch, exact publishedSHA and URL; no auto variable enablement implied. Romans an approved single-url production event with exact testURL/operation, then restore disabled mode. Verify receipt200/202 only;202 means validation pending. Provider action/config and any additional test publish require exact approval, not an inferred blanket permission.
6. Only after reviewing event-shape/provider coverage, state retention/allowances, pending-record recovery and singleURL result, approve automatic trigger enablement. All feeds, removed-URL replacement decisions, paid/account/security changes and Wizard settings stay separate.

## Validation and practical limits

Focused tests use mocked HTTP only; persist/restart and ambiguous-intent tests exercise real local state files. Site-specific host boundaries are tested. No public credentials or verification files are present. `npm run test:indexnow` is included in existing npm test flow. Node scripts add no application routing/layout change; full app builds and hosted production event wiring must be reported separately from these focused checks. Malformed/state-missing/noindex/canonical drift stops rather than guessing.
